    <h1>Our Experience with Yii</h1>
    <p>
      Overall, our team enjoyed using Yii. We found it easy to install, easy to use, and forgiving of mistakes. Yii auto-generated a lot of the code that we needed to complete this project, including a great deal of the formatting, the CRUD tool, and the model. We found the framework easy for basic use, but that it had a lot of depth for those who desire advanced features. We felt that while we understood enough to create a functional and attractive website, some of the more powerful and complex features would take more time to learn than we had available for this project.
    </p>
    <p>

      We thought that Yii would be ideal for layered, very structured sites, and that its extensibility, error handling, and advanced security would make it ideal for e-commerce sites. We recommend that when you use Yii, you should be careful with large projects because they can get out of hand in terms of code management.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also recommend that if you are new to frameworks or Yii, that you invest time in learning how the Model-View-Controller design pattern works, because it will make it easier to organize and design your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not regret our choice of frameworks. Yii is a very competitive framework that every developer should consider for their next project.
