Project Proposal: Prop Sharing

Description:

We want to build a platform that will allow Theatre departments and commercial troupes to lend, exchange, and rent props. Today, these institutions rely on word of mouth and outdated forums to exchange props, and have no common platform for doing so. Users will be able to add their props and view other institutions’ props. The use of a searchable database and pictures combined with textual descriptions will allow theatres to find the right props and to make the deals necessary to use them. When a user finds a prop that they want to use, they will click a button on that prop’s page. This will generate a notification for the owner of the prop (or place the user on a waiting list if the prop is already in use), who can then choose to respond via in app messaging system or any other form of communication given by the requester, such as by email or phone. There will be a shared calendar system that will be refineable by settings like: location, week, month, year, decade of play, or set locations. There will be a consolidated list of props, that will be searchable and can be refined in several ways. Users will be able to choose to view props only from a certain decade or in a certain category, like clothing or furniture.


Technologies:

We will be using the framework Yii. This will make implementing the database much easier, and provide a template for our frontend. Yii is a PHP based framework, so the majority of the backend will be on PHP. Ajax and JSON will be used to provide asynchronous functionality. HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript will be used for the frontend and responsiveness. The backend will be connected to a MySQL database. For monetary transactions, we will be using PayPal.
